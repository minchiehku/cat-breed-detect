## Dataset Processing

- **Dataset Source**: [Cat Breeds Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset)
- **Dataset Description**: Images of 67 cat breeds with attributes such as age, gender, size, coat, and breed.

### Data Preparation and Optimization

1. **Data Extraction and Structure Validation**
    - Downloaded and extracted the dataset from Kaggle.
    - Organized subdirectories to ensure each corresponds to a breed.
    - Resolved inconsistencies in file naming.
2. **Data Augmentation and Normalization**
    - Addressed imbalanced breed distribution by augmenting images (rotation, flipping, scaling, etc.).
    - Normalized pixel values to `[0, 1]`.
3. **Skipping Corrupted Images**
    - Implemented a safe data generator to skip invalid images during batch processing.
4. **Train-Test Split**
    - Split dataset into 80% training and 20% validation.
5. **Class Mapping and Storage**
    - Mapped breed names to numerical labels and saved as a JSON file.

    ```python    
    from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow
    
    estimator = TensorFlow(
        entry_point='train.py',
        role='YourSageMakerRole',
        instance_type='ml.p2.xlarge',
        framework_version='2.6.0',
        hyperparameters={
            'batch_size': 32,
            'epochs': 10,
            'learning_rate': 0.001
        }
    )
    estimator.fit({'training': f's3://{bucket_name}/cat_breeds'})
    
    ```
    
3. **Model Deployment**:
    - Deployed the final trained model for real-time inference using SageMakerâ€™s hosting services.

        class_labels = {v: k for k, v in class_labels.items()}
    
        img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(128, 128))
        img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
        img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    
        predictions = model.predict(img_array)
        predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)[0]
        confidence = predictions[0][predicted_class]
        print(f"Predicted Breed: {class_labels[predicted_class]}, Confidence: {confidence:.2f}")
